Goal: Write a Python function that will make every character in a string the uppercase version.

Relevent Information:
    * Use a loop that goes through each character in a string and changes it
    * Might be easier by making a new string
    * chr function is recommended
        * Function 'ord' does the opposite of chr (takes in a letter and returns binary num)
        * Lowercase letters start at 97 ('a')

Goal: Write a Python program to determine how many lego bricks would be needed to build planet Earth.

Relevent Information:
    * Radius of the Earth is ~6731 km
    * The dimensions of a lego brick are: L = 16 mm, W = 16 mm, H = 10 mm
    * 1 km = 1,000,000 mm
    * Volume of a sphere = (4/3) * pi * r^2
    * Volume of a brick = L * W * H
    * Notes:
        * The final answer is very large (Python will output it in scientific notation)
        * This problem is far easier if you convert the radius of the earth into mm early on

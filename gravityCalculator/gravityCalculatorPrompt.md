Goal: Write a Python program which will find a projected object's height after 10 seconds.

Relevent Information:
    * Formula - x(t) = (0.5 * at^2) + (vi * t) + xi
    * a = -9.81 m/s^2 (aceleration)
    * vi = 0 m/s (initial velocity)
    * t = 10 s (time)
    * xi = 0 m (initial position)
    * Looking for x(10)

Goal: Write a Python program that will swap the positions of 2 different
    values in a list.

Relevant Information:
    * Ex:
        * numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        * Swap: 3, 5
        * Output: [1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7]
    * If there are multiple instances of either value, only look at the first
      instance
    * If values 1 and 2 are the same, don't do anything

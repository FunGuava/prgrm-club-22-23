Goal: Write a Python function that will find the roots of a quadratic function by
    the quadratic formula. Also write a program that shows this functionality.

Relevant Information:
    * Quadratic Formula: (-b ± √(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / 2a
    * Quadratic Equation: ax^2 + bx + c
    * If b^2 - 4*a*c is negative, the roots are imaginery numbers
        * Print an error
    * To get the square root, include "from math import sqrt" at the top
        * Ex: sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)
    * Assume integer or float inputs (ignore fractions)

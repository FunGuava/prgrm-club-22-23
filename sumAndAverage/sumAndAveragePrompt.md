Goal: Write a Python program that will find the sum of the numbers in
    a list as well as the average of the numbers in the list.

Relevant Information:
    * Ex:
        * numbers = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        * Output: Sum - 14, Average - 2
    * You can assume that there are only valid integers or floats in the list
      and that the length is â‰¥1

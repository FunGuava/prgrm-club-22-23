Goal: Write a Python function that will determine the number of upper and lowercase
    letters in a string. Also write a program that shows this functionality.

Relevant Information:
    * There are two ways to make this function work:
        * Just print the number of upper and lowercase letters
        * End the function with "return (lower, upper)" and have the function call
          be "lower, upper = caseCalc(string)"
